            <h1>Bruce Springsteen</h1>
            <p>Born on September 23, 1949, in the town of Long Branch, New Jersey, 
            Bruce Springsteen, also known as "The Boss," played the bar circuit while 
            assembling his famous E Street Band. His breakout record "Born to Run" united 
            arena rock with human-size tales of working-class America. With dozens of awards 
            under his belt, including 20 Grammys, and selling more than 65 million albums in 
            the U.S. alone, Springsteen is one of the bestselling and popular artists of all-time. 
            He consistently sells out his tours during which he and his band play are famous for 
            performing for hours. Springsteen also has long been associated with left-leaning 
            political causes and embracing his blue collar roots. In 2016 he was honored with the 
            Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama.</p>
